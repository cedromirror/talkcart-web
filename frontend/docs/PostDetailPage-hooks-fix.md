# Post Detail Page Hooks Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The Post Detail Page was throwing a React error: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render." This error occurs when React hooks are called conditionally or in a different order between renders.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by placing a `React.useEffect` hook after conditional return statements. In React, all hooks must be called at the top level of the component, and the same number of hooks must be called on every render.

The problematic code structure was:
```javascript
// Some hooks here
if (condition) {
  return <Component />;
}
// More hooks here - this is the problem!
```

## Solution
Fixed the issue by:
1. **Moving all hooks to the top** of the component before any conditional returns
2. **Using state to manage post data** instead of extracting it after conditional returns
3. **Ensuring consistent hook order** on every render

## Code Changes
1. **Moved useEffect hook** to the top of the component with other hooks
2. **Added post state** to manage the extracted post data
3. **Restructured the component** to ensure all hooks are called before any conditional returns
4. **Updated the useEffect** to set the post state when postData changes

## Key Principles Applied
1. **React Hooks Rules**: All hooks must be called at the top level
2. **Consistent Hook Order**: Same number of hooks called on every render
3. **Early Returns**: Must come after all hooks are declared
4. **State Management**: Using useState to manage derived data

## Benefits
1. **Error Prevention**: No more "Rendered more hooks" error
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Component behaves predictably
3. **Better Performance**: Proper hook usage improves React's optimization
4. **Maintainability**: Follows React best practices

## Testing
The fix has been verified by:
1. Syntax checking with TypeScript compiler
2. Ensuring all hooks are called in consistent order
3. Verifying the component renders correctly with valid and invalid post data
