# Video Auto-Play Enhancements

This document describes the improvements made to the video auto-play functionality for better performance during scrolling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Scroll Detection
- Reduced scroll threshold from 50px to 30px for more responsive detection
- Improved velocity calculation for better sensitivity
- Adaptive delay based on scroll velocity for optimized performance
- Immediate evaluation for fast scrolls

### 2. Optimized Video Selection Algorithm
- Increased intersection threshold from 0.6 to 0.7 for better detection
- Improved sorting algorithm that prioritizes videos with higher intersection ratios
- Better handling of videos near the center of the viewport
- Reduced maximum concurrent videos from 2 to 1 for better performance

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Added throttling to intersection observer updates (~60fps limit)
- Optimized thresholds for intersection observer
- Improved error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Better preload strategy with increased preload distance
- Reduced scroll pause delay from 150ms to 100ms

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added fallback to muted autoplay when autoplay is prevented
- Better error messages for debugging
- Timeout handling for video metadata loading
- Graceful degradation when video sources are not available

### 5. New Features
- Added VideoPerformanceMonitor component for real-time performance tracking
- Added VideoAutoplayTest component for testing and demonstration
- Improved viewport position detection (above, center, below)
- Better network type detection for autoplay restrictions

## Configuration Changes

### VideoFeedManager Settings
```typescript
const settings = {
  enabled: true,
  threshold: 0.7, // Increased for better detection
  pauseOnScroll: true,
  muteByDefault: true,
  preloadStrategy: 'metadata',
  maxConcurrentVideos: 1, // Reduced for better performance
  scrollPauseDelay: 100, // Reduced for faster response
  viewTrackingThreshold: 3,
  autoplayOnlyOnWifi: false,
  respectReducedMotion: true,
};
```

### SmoothScrollVideoManager Config
```typescript
const config = {
  scrollThreshold: 30, // Reduced for more responsive detection
  velocityThreshold: 1.5, // Adjusted for better sensitivity
  debounceMs: 10, // Reduced for faster response
  preloadDistance: 300, // Increased for better preload
  smoothTransition: true,
  adaptiveQuality: true,
};
```

## Performance Metrics

The new VideoPerformanceMonitor component provides real-time metrics:
- FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Playing videos count
- Error count
- Average load time

## Testing

The VideoAutoplayTest component allows for easy testing of the auto-play functionality with configurable parameters:
- Number of videos to test
- Performance monitor visibility
- Various scroll scenarios

## Implementation Details

### PostCardEnhanced Component
- Added small delay before pausing during scroll to avoid excessive pausing
- Improved error handling for play/pause operations
- Set additional video attributes for better performance (playsInline, preload, loop)

### useVideoAutoscroll Hook
- Optimized video selection algorithm
- Better error handling with fallback to muted autoplay
- Improved performance by using ref instead of state for video data access
- Enhanced scroll detection with immediate evaluation for fast scrolls

### SmoothScrollVideoManager
- Added scroll direction tracking
- Improved video switching logic
- Better preload strategy
- Enhanced error handling with timeouts

### VideoIntersectionOptimizer
- Added throttling to prevent excessive updates
- Optimized intersection thresholds
- Improved viewport position detection
- Better performance score calculation

## Benefits

1. **Faster Response**: Reduced delays and improved scroll detection
2. **Better Performance**: Optimized algorithms and reduced resource usage
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Smoother video transitions and better error handling
4. **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance metrics for optimization

## Usage

To use the enhanced video auto-play functionality:

```tsx
import { VideoFeedProvider } from '@/components/video';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <VideoFeedProvider
      initialSettings={{
        enabled: true,
        threshold: 0.7,
        // ... other settings
      }}
    >
      {/* Your video components */}
    </VideoFeedProvider>
  );
};
```

The enhancements automatically apply to all components using the `useVideoFeed` hook within a `VideoFeedProvider`.
