## Key Improvements

### 1. TikTok-Style Layout
- Vertical scrolling feed optimized for mobile and desktop
- Full-screen media display with overlay content
- Right-side action buttons similar to TikTok
- Improved touch targets for better mobile UX

### 2. Gaming-Specific Features
- Gaming content detection based on hashtags (#gaming, #game)
- Special badges and visual indicators for gaming posts
- View count display for gaming content
- Gaming-themed color scheme and icons

### 3. Enhanced Media Handling
- Improved video loading states with skeleton loaders
- Better error handling for missing media
- Optimized video playback controls
- Mute toggle with visual feedback
- **Enhanced video playback reliability** - Better handling of video loading and playback states
- **Improved error messaging** - More specific error messages for video loading issues

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Cleaner, more modern design
- Better contrast for text overlays
- Improved accessibility
- Consistent styling across post types
- **Fixed icon visibility issues** - All action icons are now fully visible and properly sized
- **Reduced spacing between icons** - Gap reduced from 2 to 1.5 for better visual density
- **Fixed event propagation issues** - Play button no longer triggers navigation

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Reduced redundant renders
- Better memory management for video elements
- Improved lazy loading implementation
- Smoother scrolling experience

## Component Structure

### Main Container
- Full-height card with proper aspect ratio
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth transitions and animations

### Media Display
- Video player with play/pause overlay
- Image display with proper scaling
- Loading states and error handling
- Gaming badges for relevant content

### Content Overlay
- Gradient background for text readability
- Author information with follow button
- Post content with hashtag support
- Gaming-specific metadata

### Action Buttons
- **Like button with heart icon and count** - Allows users to like/unlike posts
- **Comment button with message icon and count** - Opens comment section
- **Share button with share icon and count** - Shares posts with others
- **Bookmark button with bookmark icon** - Saves posts for later
- **Menu button with three dots icon** - Opens additional options menu
- **Consistent sizing (48x48px) for better visibility**
- **Reduced gap between buttons (1.5 instead of 2) for better visual density**
- **Proper z-index and positioning to ensure full visibility**
- Consistent styling for all post types

## Technical Implementation

### Props
The component maintains the same interface as before:
```typescript
interface PostCardProps {
  post: Post;
  onBookmark?: (postId: string) => void;
  onLike?: (postId: string) => void;
  onShare?: (postId: string) => void;
  onComment?: (postId: string) => void;
}
```

### State Management
- Video playback state
- User interaction states (liked, bookmarked, following)
- Media loading states
- Menu open/close state

### Hooks Used
- `useVideoFeed` for video management
- `useMediaMute` for audio control
- Standard React hooks for state and effects

## Video Playback Enhancements

### Improved Video Loading
- **Enhanced loading detection** with both `loadeddata` and `canplay` events
- **Timeout handling** with 15-second limit for video loading (increased from 10)
- **Error handling** for failed video loads with user feedback
- **Graceful degradation** when video sources are unavailable
- **Specific error messages** for different types of video loading failures

### Playback Reliability
- **AbortError handling** for rapid video switching scenarios
- **Retry mechanism** with short delays for interrupted play requests
- **State synchronization** between component and video element
- **Proper cleanup** of event listeners to prevent memory leaks

### Video Element Configuration
- **PlaysInline** enabled for mobile Safari compatibility
- **Preload metadata** for efficient loading
- **Loop enabled** for continuous playback
- **Mute synchronization** with global mute state

### Event Handling
- **Enhanced event propagation prevention** - Play button clicks no longer trigger navigation
- **Improved click detection** - Better identification of interactive elements
- **PreventDefault and StopPropagation** on all interactive elements

### URL Handling
- **Cloudinary proxy support** - Properly proxies Cloudinary URLs to avoid CORS issues
- **URL validation** - Validates media URLs before attempting to load
- **Fallback handling** - Shows placeholder when video URLs are missing or invalid

## Styling Approach

### Color Scheme
- Dark theme optimized for media consumption
- High contrast for text overlays
- Brand colors for interactive elements
- Transparent backgrounds for UI elements

### Responsive Design
- Flexible container that adapts to screen size
- Properly sized touch targets
- Adaptive text sizing
- Mobile-first approach

## Testing

All testing has been completed and verified functionality works as expected.

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None expected - maintains same API

### Deprecations
- None

### Performance Impact
- Improved due to better optimization
- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster initial render times

## Recent Fixes

### Comment Functionality Fix
- **Issue**: Comment button was showing "Comments feature coming soon!" message
- **Root Cause**: The parent component ([social.tsx](file:///d:/talkcart/frontend/pages/social.tsx)) had a placeholder function that just showed a toast
- **Fix**: Updated [handleCommentPost](file:///d:/talkcart/frontend/pages/social.tsx#L132-L136) function in [social.tsx](file:///d:/talkcart/frontend/pages/social.tsx) to properly navigate to post detail page with comment focus
- **Result**: Comment button now works correctly and navigates to the post page

### Like Button Visibility Fix
- **Issue**: Like button was partially visible or missing
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect positioning or sizing
- **Fix**: Ensured all action buttons have consistent sizing (48x48px) and proper positioning
- **Result**: Like button is now fully visible and properly sized

### Icon Spacing Fix
- **Issue**: Excessive spacing between action icons
- **Root Cause**: Gap value was too large (2)
- **Fix**: Reduced gap from 2 to 1.5 for better visual density
- **Result**: Icons are now properly spaced with better visual appeal

### Video Playback Enhancement
- **Issue**: Video playback reliability issues
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate error handling and state management
- **Fix**: Enhanced video loading detection, timeout handling, and AbortError management
- **Result**: More reliable video playback with better user feedback

### Event Propagation Fix
- **Issue**: Play button clicks were triggering navigation to post page
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate event propagation prevention
- **Fix**: Enhanced event handling with preventDefault and stopPropagation on all interactive elements
- **Result**: Play button now works correctly without triggering navigation

### Video Loading Error Fix
- **Issue**: Generic "Failed to load video" error message
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate error handling with no specific error details
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling with specific error messages for different failure types
- **Result**: Users now see specific error messages that help diagnose video loading issues
