# 🔔 Call Notification System - Testing Instructions

## 🚀 **Frontend is Running on Port 4000**

The frontend server is now running at: **http://localhost:4000**

## 🧪 **Testing Methods Available**

### **Method 1: Standalone HTML Test (Immediate Testing)**
1. **Open the test file**: `d:\talkcart\frontend\public\test-notifications.html`
   - This file should have opened automatically in your browser
   - If not, double-click the file or drag it to your browser

2. **Grant Permissions**:
   - Click "Request All Permissions"
   - Allow notifications when prompted
   - Allow audio autoplay when prompted

3. **Test Individual Components**:
   - Click "Test Ringtone (5s)" - You should hear a loud, pleasant ringtone
   - Click "Test Vibration" - Your mobile device should vibrate
   - Click "Test Notification" - A browser notification should appear

4. **Test Full Call Simulation**:
   - Click "Simulate Incoming Call"
   - **You should experience ALL of the following simultaneously**:
     - 🔊 **Loud ringtone playing continuously**
     - 🔔 **Browser notification with "INCOMING AUDIO CALL"**
     - 📳 **Continuous vibration** (on mobile devices)
   - Click "🛑 STOP ALL ALERTS" to end the test

### **Method 2: Integrated Next.js Test**
1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:4000/test/call-notifications`
2. **Follow the same testing steps** as Method 1
3. **This tests the actual React components** that will be used in production

### **Method 3: Messages Page Integration Test**
1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:4000/messages`
2. **Select a conversation** (if available)
3. **Look for the CallManager component** - it should be integrated
4. **Permission dialog should appear** on first use
5. **Call buttons should trigger** the notification system

## ✅ **What You Should Experience**

### **When Testing "Simulate Incoming Call":**

1. **Immediate Response** (within 500ms):
   ```
   🔔 Browser notification appears with title: "🔔 INCOMING AUDIO CALL"
   🔊 Loud ringtone starts playing at high volume
   📳 Mobile device vibrates with strong pattern (if supported)
   💻 Console shows: "🔔 Starting incoming call alert for: John Doe"
   ```

2. **Continuous Alerts**:
   ```
   🔊 Ringtone loops continuously (every ~3 seconds)
   📳 Vibration repeats every ~3 seconds (mobile only)
   🔔 Notification stays visible and clickable
   ⏰ All alerts continue for 30 seconds or until stopped
   ```

3. **When You Stop**:
   ```
   🔇 All sounds stop immediately
   📳 Vibration stops immediately
   🔔 Notifications are cleared
   💻 Console shows: "🔇 Stopping all call alerts"
   ```

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**

### **For Complete Testing**:
1. **Open the test page on your mobile device**:
   - Android: Open `test-notifications.html` in Chrome/Firefox
   - iPhone: Open `test-notifications.html` in Safari
   
2. **Grant permissions** when prompted

3. **Test vibration specifically**:
   - Only works on Android devices
   - iOS Safari doesn't support vibration (this is normal)
   - Should feel strong, repeating vibration pattern

4. **Test background notifications**:
   - Start the call simulation
   - Switch to another app or home screen
   - Notification should still appear and ringtone should play

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **No Sound Playing?**
- **Solution**: Click anywhere on the page first (browser autoplay policy)
- **Check**: Volume is not muted
- **Check**: Browser allows audio autoplay

### **No Notifications?**
- **Solution**: Grant notification permissions when prompted
- **Check**: Browser supports notifications
- **Check**: System notifications are not disabled

### **No Vibration?**
- **Expected**: Only works on mobile devices
