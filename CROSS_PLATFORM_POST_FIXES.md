# Cross-Platform Post Functionality Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes applied to ensure post functionality works consistently across different platforms and environments.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Cross-Platform URL Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent URL normalization and validation across client/server environments.

**Solution**: 
- Created `crossPlatformUtils.ts` with unified URL handling
- Added support for data URLs, blob URLs, and relative URLs
- Implemented automatic duplicate path fixing (`/uploads/talkcart/talkcart/` â†’ `/uploads/talkcart/`)
- Added cross-platform base URL detection

### 2. Media Display Issues
**Problem**: Media elements failing to load due to invalid URLs and hydration mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `PostListItem.tsx` with client-side hydration checks
- Added comprehensive error handling for media loading
- Implemented fallback UI for failed media loads
- Added preload attributes for better performance

### 3. API Response Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Different data structures returned by different endpoints.

**Solution**:
- Updated backend routes to return consistent data structures
- Added `normalizePostData` utility for frontend data normalization
- Ensured all required fields are present with proper defaults
- Added cross-platform compatibility fields
