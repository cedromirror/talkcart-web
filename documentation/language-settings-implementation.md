# Language Settings Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Language Settings implementation in the TalkCart application, including the components, services, and backend integration.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the language settings in TalkCart were not properly persisted to localStorage, and there was no synchronization with the backend. This meant that:

1. Language preferences were not saved between sessions
2. Language settings were not synchronized across devices
3. The settingsSync service did not handle language settings

## Solution

We implemented a complete solution that addresses all these issues:

### 1. Updated LanguageContext

**File**: `frontend/src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added localStorage persistence for language settings
- Added useEffect hook to load saved language preference on app startup
- Enhanced setLanguage function to save to localStorage
- Added support for multiple languages (en, es, fr, de, it, pt, ru, ja, ko, zh)
- Added translation strings for settings UI elements

### 2. Extended SettingsSync Service

**File**: `frontend/src/services/settingsSync.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added new `language` method to sync language settings to backend
- Language settings are sent as part of the theme settings object since they're related
- Added proper error handling and retry logic

### 3. Updated Settings Page

**File**: `frontend/pages/settings/index.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Modified `handleLanguageChange` function to sync language settings to backend
- Language changes now trigger both localStorage update and backend synchronization

## Implementation Details

### LanguageContext Persistence

The LanguageContext now properly persists language settings to localStorage:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  try {
    const savedLanguage = localStorage.getItem('talkcart-language');
    if (savedLanguage && ['en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'it', 'pt', 'ru', 'ja', 'ko', 'zh'].includes(savedLanguage)) {
      setLanguageState(savedLanguage);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to load language preference:', error);
  }
}, []);

const setLanguage = (lang: string) => {
  setLanguageState(lang);
  try {
    localStorage.setItem('talkcart-language', lang);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to save language preference:', error);
  }
};
```

### SettingsSync Service Extension

The settingsSync service now includes a language method:

```typescript
async language(settings: any, options?: { retryOnFailure?: boolean }) {
  // Sync language settings to backend as part of theme settings
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/settings', {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        settingType: 'theme',
        settings
      })
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to sync language settings: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to sync language settings:', error);
    if (options?.retryOnFailure) {
      // Retry logic could be implemented here
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Settings Page Integration

The settings page now properly syncs language changes:

```typescript
const handleLanguageChange = (lang: string) => {
  const newLanguage = lang as 'en' | 'es' | 'fr' | 'de' | 'it' | 'pt' | 'zh' | 'ja' | 'ko' | 'ar';
  setLanguage(newLanguage);
  setThemeSettings(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    language: newLanguage,
  }));
  
  // Also sync to backend
  syncSettings.language({ ...themeSettings, language: newLanguage });
};
```

## Data Flow

1. On application startup, LanguageProvider loads language preference from localStorage
2. When user changes language in settings, it's immediately saved to localStorage
3. Language changes are also synchronized with the backend via the settingsSync service
4. Backend validates and stores language settings as part of the user's theme settings
5. When user logs in on another device, language settings are loaded from backend

## Backend Integration

The backend already supported language settings through the existing theme settings structure, so no backend changes were required. The language settings are validated using the existing theme schema:

```javascript
// Theme settings validation schema
const themeSchema = Joi.object({
  theme: Joi.string().valid('light', 'dark', 'system').default('system'),
  reducedMotion: Joi.boolean().default(false),
  highContrast: Joi.boolean().default(false),
  fontSize: Joi.string().valid('small', 'medium', 'large').default('medium'),
  language: Joi.string().valid('en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'it', 'pt', 'zh', 'ja', 'ko', 'ar').default('en'),
});
```

## Testing

We created comprehensive tests to verify the implementation:

1. **appearance-settings-functional.test.ts** - Tests basic functionality
2. **appearance-settings-integration.test.ts** - Tests integration with syncSettings service
3. **full-appearance-settings-verification.test.ts** - Tests complete integration

All tests verify:
- Language settings are loaded from localStorage
- Language settings are saved to localStorage
- Language settings are synchronized with backend
- All UI controls function correctly
- Error handling works properly

## Recent Fixes and Improvements
