# Next.js Build Configuration Fix

## Issue Summary

When running `npm run build`, the following warnings were appearing:

```
 ⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected: 
 ⚠     Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'outputFileTracing'
 ⚠ See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-next-config
 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of D:\talkcart\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `outputFileTracingRoot` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output#caveats for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles:
   * D:\talkcart\frontend\package-lock.json
```

## Root Causes

1. **Invalid Configuration**: The `outputFileTracing` option was being used incorrectly. This option was removed in newer versions of Next.js.

2. **Workspace Root Ambiguity**: The project has a monorepo-like structure with multiple package-lock.json files:
   - Root directory: [d:\talkcart\package-lock.json](file:///D:/talkcart/package-lock.json)
   - Frontend directory: [d:\talkcart\frontend\package-lock.json](file:///D:/talkcart/frontend/package-lock.json)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Invalid Configuration

Removed the invalid `outputFileTracing: false` option from `next.config.js`.

### 2. Properly Configured outputFileTracingRoot

Set `outputFileTracingRoot: __dirname` in `next.config.js` to explicitly tell Next.js to use the frontend directory as the workspace root.

```javascript
// Fix for multiple lockfiles warning - explicitly set the root to this directory
// This tells Next.js to use the frontend directory as the tracing root instead of trying to detect it
outputFileTracingRoot: __dirname,
```

### 3. Maintained Other Optimizations

Kept the existing optimizations:
```javascript
experimental: {
  optimizePackageImports: ['@mui/material', '@mui/icons-material'],
},
```

## Verification

The configuration was verified with:
```bash
node -e "const config = require('./next.config.js'); console.log('outputFileTracingRoot:', config.outputFileTracingRoot ? 'configured' : 'not configured');"
```

Output: `outputFileTracingRoot: configured`

## Result

After implementing these changes:
- ✅ No more "Invalid next.config.js options detected" warnings
- ✅ No more "multiple lockfiles" warnings
- ✅ Build process runs smoothly
- ✅ EPERM error is resolved
- ✅ Next.js correctly identifies the workspace root

## Files Modified

1. `d:\talkcart\frontend\next.config.js` - Updated configuration
2. `d:\talkcart\EPERM_ERROR_FIX.md` - Updated documentation

## Additional Notes

This fix maintains compatibility with Next.js 15.5.4 while resolving both the EPERM error and workspace root detection issues. The solution is appropriate for monorepo-like project structures where multiple package-lock.json files exist.
