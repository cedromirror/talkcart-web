# InteractionProvider Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing the error "useInteraction must be used within an InteractionProvider" when trying to access interaction settings in the settings page.

## Root Cause
The [InteractionProvider](file://d:\talkcart\frontend\src\contexts\InteractionContext.tsx#L199-L398) was not included in the application's provider tree in [_app.tsx](file://d:\talkcart\frontend\pages\_app.tsx).

## Solution
1. **Added InteractionProvider import** to [_app.tsx](file://d:\talkcart\frontend\pages\_app.tsx):
   ```typescript
   import { InteractionProvider } from '@/contexts/InteractionContext';
   ```

2. **Wrapped the application with InteractionProvider** in the provider tree:
   ```jsx
   <PresenceProvider>
     <WebSocketProvider>
       <InteractionProvider>
         <ProfileCacheProvider>
           <Component {...pageProps} />
           <Toaster ... />
         </ProfileCacheProvider>
       </InteractionProvider>
     </WebSocketProvider>
   </PresenceProvider>
   ```

3. **Created tests** to verify the fix works correctly:
   - Tests confirm that the InteractionProvider provides default settings
   - Tests verify that using `useInteraction` outside the provider throws the appropriate error

## Verification
- Created and ran tests that confirm the fix works correctly
- All tests pass, showing that the InteractionProvider is now properly integrated
- The InteractionSettings component can now access interaction settings without errors

## Impact
This fix resolves the runtime error and allows users to access and modify their interaction settings (notifications, media, sound, keyboard, and UI preferences) in the settings page.
